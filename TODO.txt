Scenes and Structure
  - What is a scene, why do we use them
  - How do you scene transitions happen
  - how (and why) do you use more than one at a time
  - what state is associated with a scene and how do you share information
    between them
  - example: trivial dot clicking thing (let's call it ZenGame)
  - homework: Rewrite first game using a more extensible structure

Adding atmosphere
  - Music
  - graphical effects (filters & masks)
  - example: add music and blur effect to background scene in ZenGame
  - homework: add music and sound effects to FirstGame

Some Polish
  - Menu system
  - Session local (i.e. not using local storage) high scores
  - Tweening in some basic UI shit
  - example: session "high scores" (time played per round) on ZenGame
  - homework: Add menus and leaderboards to FirstGame

Competition
  - Local coop
  - Textboxy UI element (HTML?)
  - remote leaderboard (basics of fetch API + polyfill + running an API)
  - example: add Name to ZenGame, submit playtime to remote server
  - homework: add a second player to FirstGame, Take user names & track wins

Remote Competition
  - Remote competition
    - TODO: what similar stuff maps to ZenGame?
  - labby
  - example: add state-saving to ZenGame to simulate game state transfer
    & authoritative server
  - homework: add lobby + game setup + remote comp

Ultimate goal
  I'd like to get to a place where we've modified the FirstGame project to have
  a functional menu system along with high scores and local/remote competition
  gameplay modes and a lobby.
